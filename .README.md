INFO FOR TEAM MEMBERS:

To run the project locally: open a terminal window and navigate to your project location, then clone the repository with "git clone https://github.com/MarkusKeinanen/user-interface.git"
After this, navigate in the terminal to the "user-interface" project and enter the command "npm install"
After this, run the project by entering "npm start". This command runs the "start"-script in package.json which starts a new webpack-dev-server (a simulation of a real server on your PC)
